  vboxinit: auto start sessions when booting and save
                sessions when host is stopped

  Based on vboxtool. Rewrtitten/modified  for OpenSuSE by jetchisel.

 
 copy this script to /etc/init.d
 uncomment "var $startStopConfig = true;" in phpvirtualbox's php.ini
 Configure vms in phpvirtualbox's graphical menu for statupmode = automatic
 
  run:
      chmod u+rx /etc/init.d/vboxinit
      #for Debian update-rc.d vboxinit defaults
      for SuSE   chkconfig vboxinit on
  

 For testing the script as root run:  
 /etc/init.d/vboxinit {start|stop|restart|status}
 
 Note the script runs the vms as a normal user that is defined in /etc/default/virtualbox 
      and belongs to the vboxusers group so you will not worry about running the script as
      root.
